# About the Project

This is a project from the Coursera - having all resources are retrieved from *https://www.coursera.org/learn/covid19-data-analysis-using-python/home/info*. Covid 19 dataset, which is published by John Hopkins University, is merged with world happiness report containing the various life factors of people to see how the world infection rate is related to these lift factors.

**Insights**

As we can see from the graphs generated through Python, maximum infection rates tends to increase with happiness factors scores. This sounds counterintuitive at first, but this is due to several factors. Countries with high world happiness scores have the following:

- **Robust public health systems** - countries with high happiness scores have better healthcare systems, allowing them to test and detect more Covid-19 cases.
- **Transparency and data accuracy** - countries with high happiness scores have good governance and transparent to reporting activities.
- **Community and social support** - people in countries with high happiness scores are more compliant in testing and tracking protocols.
- **Budget for testing kits** - more developed countries have more budget for testing kits, allowing them to detect more infection cases.
